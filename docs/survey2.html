<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Description of Survey Items and Scales</h1>

</div>


<p>The 2020 Class Survey for 431 includes 65 items.</p>
<ul>
<li>For information on taking the survey, <a href="survey1.html">go here</a> (deadline is 2020-11-11 at 11 PM).</li>
<li>For information on getting the data once the survey is complete, <a href="survey3.html">go here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Survey items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Perceived Stress Scale (10 items)</li>
<li>The Health Information Orientation Scale (8 items)</li>
<li>A modified Insomnia Severity Index (7 items)</li>
<li>40 items that are not part of a scale (these were developed by students in previous 431 classes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we list each of these items, and describe the scoring and grouping of the three scales.</p>
<div id="the-perceived-stress-scale-10-items" class="section level2">
<h2>The Perceived Stress Scale (10 items)</h2>
<p>In the past month, how often have you …</p>
<p>(available responses are Never, Almost Never, Sometimes, Fairly Often and Very Often)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PSS-01</strong>. been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?</li>
<li><strong>PSS-02</strong>. felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?</li>
<li><strong>PSS-03</strong>. felt nervous and stressed?</li>
<li><strong>PSS-04</strong>. felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?</li>
<li><strong>PSS-05</strong>. felt that things were going your way?</li>
<li><strong>PSS-06</strong>. found that you could not cope with all the things that you had to do?</li>
<li><strong>PSS-07</strong>. been able to control irritations in your life?</li>
<li><strong>PSS-08</strong>. felt that you were on top of things?</li>
<li><strong>PSS-09</strong>. been angered because of things that happened that were outside of your control?</li>
<li><strong>PSS-10</strong>. felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?</li>
</ul>
<div id="scoring-for-the-pss" class="section level3">
<h3>Scoring for the PSS</h3>
<p>Each item on the Perceived Stress Scale is measured on a scale from 0-4. Sum the item scores for a subject to determine their PSS score, between 0 and 40.</p>
<ul>
<li>For items PSS-01, -02, -03, -06, -09, and -10, the scale is 0 for Never, 1 for Almost Never, 2 for Sometimes, 3 for Fairly Often and 4 for Very Often</li>
<li>For items PSS-04, -05, -07 and -08, the scale is reversed, so 4 for Never, 3 for Almost Never, 2 for Sometimes, 1 for Fairly Often and 0 for Very Often</li>
</ul>
<p>We will generally treat the PSS score as quantitative, with higher PSS scores indicating higher perceived stress. There are popular cutoffs creating three categories at:</p>
<ul>
<li>0-13 indicating low perceived stress</li>
<li>14-26 indicating moderate perceived stress, and</li>
<li>27-40 indicating high perceived stress.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-health-information-orientation-scale-8-items" class="section level2">
<h2>The Health Information Orientation Scale (8 items)</h2>
<p>Each of these are answered on a scale of 1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HIOS-1</strong>. I make it a point to read and watch stories about health.</li>
<li><strong>HIOS-2</strong>. I really enjoy learning about health issues.</li>
<li><strong>HIOS-3</strong>. To be and stay healthy it’s critical to be informed about health issues.</li>
<li><strong>HIOS-4</strong>. The amount of health information available today makes it easier for me to take care of my health.</li>
<li><strong>HIOS-5</strong>. When I take medicine, I try to get as much information as possible about its benefits and side effects.</li>
<li><strong>HIOS-6</strong>. I need to know about health issues so I can keep myself and my family healthy.</li>
<li><strong>HIOS-7</strong>. Before making a decision about my health, I find out everything I can about this issue.</li>
<li><strong>HIOS-8</strong>. It’s important to me to be informed about health issues.</li>
</ul>
<div id="scoring-for-the-hios" class="section level3">
<h3>Scoring for the HIOS</h3>
<p>Each item on the Health Information Orientation Scale is measured on a scale from 1-5. Take the mean of all items to which the subject responds to establish their HIOS score.</p>
<p>We will generally treat the HIOS score as quantitative, with higher HIOS scores indicating a stronger orientation towards gathering health information.</p>
<p>There are popular cutoffs creating five categories at:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - 1.50 indicating very low health information orientation</li>
<li>1.51 - 2.50 indicating low health information orientation</li>
<li>2.51 - 3.50 indicating moderate health information orientation</li>
<li>3.51 - 4.50 indicating high health information orientation, and</li>
<li>4.51 - 5.00 indicating very high health information orientation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="modified-insomnia-severity-index-7-items" class="section level2">
<h2>modified Insomnia Severity Index (7 items)</h2>
<p>responses for items 1-3 are None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), Very Severe (4)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mISI-1</strong>. In the past two weeks, how much difficulty did you have falling asleep?</li>
<li><strong>mISI-2</strong>. In the past two weeks, how much difficulty did you have staying asleep?</li>
<li><strong>mISI-3</strong>. In the past two weeks, how much difficulty did you have with waking up too early?</li>
</ul>
<p>responses for item 4 are Very Satisfied (0), Satisfied (1), Neutral (2), Dissatisfied (3), Very Dissatisfied (4)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mISI-4</strong>. How SATISFIED/DISSATISFIED are you with your CURRENT sleep pattern?</li>
</ul>
<p>responses for items 5-7 are Not at all (0), A Little (1), Somewhat (2), Much (3), Very Much (4)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mISI-5</strong>. How NOTICEABLE to others do you think your sleep pattern is in terms of impairing the quality of your life?</li>
<li><strong>mISI-6</strong>. How WORRIED/DISTRESSED are you about your current sleep?</li>
<li><strong>mISI-7</strong>. To what extent do you consider your sleep pattern to INTERFERE with your daily functioning (e.g. daytime fatigue, mood, ability to function at work/daily chores, concentration, memory, mood, etc.) CURRENTLY?</li>
</ul>
<div id="scoring-for-the-misi" class="section level3">
<h3>Scoring for the mISI</h3>
<p>Each item involves a choice from five possible responses, scored 0-4. Add the 7 item scores to estimate the index. Higher scores on the index indicate more substantial problems with sleep. There are popular cutoffs creating four categories of sleep problems, which we might interpret as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-meaningful (or modest) sleep problems: 0 - 7 points</li>
<li>Low severity sleep problems: 8 - 14 points</li>
<li>Moderate severity sleep problems: 15 - 21 points</li>
<li>High severity sleep problems: 22 - 28 points</li>
</ul>

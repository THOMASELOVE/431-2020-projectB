# Submitting Your Study 1 Report

Your Study 1 Report is to be submitted to Canvas by 2020-12-10 at Noon.

- This submission should include both your R Markdown and HTML results.
- Be sure that the names of your R Markdown and HTML files clearly identify whose project is being submitted, and an indication that these files refer to study 1.
- If you are working with a partner, one of you should submit both the Study 1 and Study 2 reports to Canvas, and the other person should submit a one-page note to Canvas (word or PDF is best) containing your name, and stating something like "I worked on Project B with [your partner's name] and they will submit Project B for our group."

# Submitting Your Study 2 Report

Your Study 2 Report is to be submitted to Canvas by 2020-12-10 at Noon.

- This submission should include both your R Markdown and HTML results.
- In addition, if you worked with any data other than NHANES, your submission also needs to include your data (in the form you used to ingest the data in your R Markdown file, so that we can run your R Markdown code and obtain your HTML results.)
- Be sure that the names of your R Markdown and HTML files clearly identify whose project is being submitted, and an indication that these files refer to study 2.
- Again, if you are working with a partner, one of you should submit both the Study 1 and Study 2 reports to Canvas, and the other person should submit a one-page note to Canvas (word or PDF is best) containing your name, and stating something like "I worked on Project B with [your partner's name] and they will submit Project B for our group."

# Oral Presentation of Results

Dr. Love will pose a series of questions about these Studies right after Thanksgiving, and you will respond to them in December through a short oral presentation.
    1. Some project groups will do a pre-recorded video presentation.
    2. The remaining project groups will have a live Zoom meeting with Dr. Love.

Further details on the presentations, including the questions you will need to address, will be communicated to you by 2020-11-30.

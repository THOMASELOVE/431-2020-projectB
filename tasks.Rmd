# Submitting Your Study 1 Report

Your Study 1 Report is to be submitted to Canvas by 2020-12-10 at Noon.

- This submission should include both your R Markdown and HTML results.
- Be sure that the names of your R Markdown and HTML files clearly identify whose project is being submitted, and an indication that these files refer to study 1.
- If you are working with a partner, one of you should submit both the Study 1 and Study 2 reports to Canvas, and the other person should submit a one-page note to Canvas (word or PDF is best) containing your name, and stating something like "I worked on Project B with [your partner's name] and they will submit Project B for our group."

# Submitting Your Study 2 Report

Your Study 2 Report is to be submitted to Canvas by 2020-12-10 at Noon.

- This submission should include both your R Markdown and HTML results.
- In addition, if you worked with any data other than NHANES, your submission also needs to include your data (in the form you used to ingest the data in your R Markdown file, so that we can run your R Markdown code and obtain your HTML results.)
- Be sure that the names of your R Markdown and HTML files clearly identify whose project is being submitted, and an indication that these files refer to study 2.
- Again, if you are working with a partner, one of you should submit both the Study 1 and Study 2 reports to Canvas, and the other person should submit a one-page note to Canvas (word or PDF is best) containing your name, and stating something like "I worked on Project B with [your partner's name] and they will submit Project B for our group."

# Oral Presentation of Results

On 2020-12-01, Dr. Love will pose a series of questions about your two Studies, and you will respond to those questions through a short oral presentation.

1. A substantial majority of the project groups will prepare a pre-recorded video presentation to respond to Dr. Love's questions, and that, too, will be due on 2020-12-10 at noon.

2. A few (12-15) of the project groups will instead meet through Zoom with Dr. Love to have a 15-20 minute conversation about their Project B on either 2020-12-09, 2020-12-10, or 2020-12-11.
    - Students in these groups will be identified from among those students who will be in the Eastern time zone in North America on the dates in question, and whose project or project members fit into at least one of the following categories:
        - undergraduate students,
        - candidates for the MS in Health Care Analytics within the PQHS department, 
        - candidates for the PhD within the PQHS department, 
        - struggled with Project A, 
        - are using, in Study 2, a data set in which Dr. Love has a special interest
    - Not all students in those situations will meet with Dr. Love. 
    - Details on who will meet will be provided on 2020-12-01.

Further details on the presentations, including the questions you will need to address, will be communicated to you on 2020-12-01.

# Self-Evaluation for Project B

The Self-Evaluation for Project B Form will appear at http://bit.ly/431-projectB-self-evaluation by 2020-12-01. It will be due at noon on 2020-12-10.

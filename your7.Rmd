Links will be provided below to R Markdown and HTML versions of Sample Study 2 demonstration materials as they become available.

Remember that a general outline and set of instructions for the Study 2 report [is available here](your6.html). 

A demonstration of four key elements of Study 2 analyses will be linked here, specifically...

- partitioning the data into training and test samples
- considering transformations for an outcome
- an in-sample (training sample) comparison of models
- an out-of-sample (test sample) comparison of models

These materials will appear before the Thanksgiving Break.

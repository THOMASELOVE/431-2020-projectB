You have two options in terms of a data set you will use in Study 2.

### Data from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). 

- Details on what is required if you're working with NHANES data [are found here](your2.html).

### Data you select from any other source that meets with Dr. Love's approval. 

- Details on what is required if you're not working with NHANES data [are found here](your3.html).
